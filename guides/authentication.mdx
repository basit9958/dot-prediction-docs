---

The Dot Prediction API uses two authentication methods depending on the type of endpoint you're accessing.

## API key authentication

All data endpoints (markets, events, series, profiles, etc.) require an API key. You can pass your key using either method:

**Header (recommended):**
```bash
curl https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/markets?provider=polymarket \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Bearer token:**
```bash
curl https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/markets?provider=polymarket \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secret. Do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Session authentication

Account management endpoints (creating API keys, managing subscriptions) use JWT cookie-based sessions. A session cookie is set automatically when you register or log in.

### Register

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "password": "your-password"
  }'
```

**Validation rules:**
- `name`: minimum 3 characters
- `email`: valid email format
- `password`: 6-16 characters

### Log in

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "password": "your-password"
  }'
```

### Log out

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/auth/logout \
  -b "jwt=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"
```

## Google OAuth

You can also authenticate using Google OAuth. Redirect users to the OAuth endpoint:

```
GET https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/auth/google
```

This redirects to Google's sign-in page. After authentication, the user is redirected back with a session cookie.

## Managing API keys

### Create a key

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/auth/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "jwt=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -d '{"name": "production-key"}'
```

The `name` field must be 2-64 characters. The response includes the plaintext key — save it immediately, as it cannot be retrieved later.

### List keys

```bash
curl https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/auth/api-keys \
  -b "jwt=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"
```

Returns all your API keys with their prefix, creation date, and last used timestamp.

### Revoke a key

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/auth/api-keys/KEY_ID \
  -b "jwt=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"
```

Revoked keys are immediately invalidated and cannot be used for authentication.

## Error responses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `401` | Missing or invalid API key / session |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded (see [Rate limiting](/guides/rate-limiting)) |
