Dot Prediction aggregates data from multiple prediction market platforms. Each platform has different capabilities — not all endpoints are available for every provider.

## Supported platforms

### Limitless

An emerging prediction market data source with a growing catalog of markets.

## Capabilities matrix

| Endpoint | Kalshi | Polymarket | Limitless |
|----------|--------|------------|-----------|
| [List markets](/api-reference/endpoint/list-markets) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Get market](/api-reference/endpoint/get-market) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Order book](/api-reference/endpoint/get-market-orderbook) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Trades](/api-reference/endpoint/get-market-trades) | Yes | Yes | No |
| [Price history](/api-reference/endpoint/get-market-price-history) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [List events](/api-reference/endpoint/list-events) | Yes | Yes | No |
| [Get event](/api-reference/endpoint/get-event) | Yes | Yes | No |
| [List series](/api-reference/endpoint/list-series) | Yes | Yes | No |
| [Get series](/api-reference/endpoint/get-series) | Yes | Yes | No |

## The `provider` parameter

All data endpoints require a `provider` query parameter specifying which platform to query.

```bash
# Query Kalshi markets
curl "https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/markets?provider=kalshi" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Query Polymarket markets
curl "https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/markets?provider=polymarket" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

If you request an endpoint that isn't supported by the specified provider, the API returns a `400` error.

## Discovering capabilities

Use the [List platforms](/api-reference/endpoint/list-platforms) endpoint to programmatically check which capabilities each platform supports:

```bash
curl https://api.dotprediction.io/v1/api/platforms \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
